# Code Reference Tool
A C# tool made to help you code in C++. It let's you browse through [cppreference.com](https://cppreference.com) dynamically on-and offline. You can take notes on each subject and search for them whenever you're in need of it.

## How: 
Made in C# with WPF, using the Mvvm pattern. I made use of:  

* Xml-Serialization
* Mvvm-Light
* Reflection
* Events
* Linq
* DataBinding
* Delegates
* Networking

## Features: 
* The whole tool works fully online, offline and dynamically between them.
* Automatically retrieves the whole archive if you want to work offline.
* You can write notes/remarks per page and easily access remarks you’ve written down on the page.
* You can browse through the whole cppreference archive by either: Using the tree-view one the left, searching with the search bar or browsing through the webpages. Everything is responsive so if you click on a link in the browser, the tree-view updates itself to reflect what’s on the screen.
